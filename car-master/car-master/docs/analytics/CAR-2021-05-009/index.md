CertUtil.exe may be used to `encode` and `decode` a file, including PE and script code. Encoding will convert a file to base64 with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` tags. Malicious usage will include decoding a encoded file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process. Note that there are two additional command switches that may be used - `encodehex` and `decodehex`. Similarly, the file will be encoded in HEX and later decoded for further execution. During triage, identify the source of the file being decoded. Review its contents or execution behavior for further analysis.


### ATT&CK Detection

|Technique|Subtechnique(s)|Tactic(s)|Level of Coverage|
|---|---|---|---|

### Implementations

#### Pseudocode – CertUtil with Decode Argument (Pseudocode, CAR native)


Pseudocode implementation of the Splunk search below


```
processes = search Process:Create
certutil_downloads = filter processes where (
  exe =”C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe” AND command_line = *decode* )
output certutil_downloads
```


#### Splunk code ()




#### Splunk, Endpoint

To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.


```
| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=certutil.exe Processes.process=*decode* by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
```



### Unit Tests

#### Test Case 1

**Configurations:** Using Splunk [Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range)

Replay the detection [dataset](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/splunk/attack_data/master/datasets/attack_techniques/T1140/atomic_red_team/windows-sysmon.log)  using the Splunk attack range with the commands below

```
python attack_range.py replay -dn data_dump [--dump NAME_OF_DUMP]
```

#### Test Case 2

**Configurations:** Using [Invoke-AtomicRedTeam](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam)

execute the atomic test [T1140](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/tree/master/atomics/T1140) against a Windows target.

```
Invoke-AtomicTest T1140
```
