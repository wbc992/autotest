In an attempt to avoid detection after compromising a machine, threat actors often try to disable Windows Defender. This is often done using “sc” [service control], a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for managing services. This action interferes with event detection and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.

### Implementations

#### Splunk search - Detecting Tampering of Windows Defender Command Prompt (Splunk, Sysmon native)


This query looks for the specific use of service control for querying or trying to stop Windows Defender.


```
index= __your_sysmon__index__ EventCode=1 Image = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\sc.exe"  | regex CommandLine="^sc\s*(config|stop|query)\sWinDefend$"
```


#### Splunk search - Detecting Tampering of Windows Defender Command Prompt (Pseudocode)


This query looks for the specific use of service control for querying or trying to stop Windows Defender.


```
processes = search Process:Create
target_processes = filter processes where (
                   (exe="C:\\Windows\\System32\\sc.exe") AND (command_line="sc *config*" OR command_line="sc *stop*" OR command_line="sc *query*")
                   )
output target_processes
```
