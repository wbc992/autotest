Adversaries may use network shares to exfliltrate date; they will then remove the shares to cover their tracks. This analytic looks for the removal of network shares via commandline, which is otherwise a rare event.

### Implementations

#### Pseudocode - network shares being removed via the command line (Pseudocode, CAR native)


This is a pseudocode representation of the below splunk search.


```
processes = search Process:Create
target_processes = filter processes where (
  (exe="C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe" AND command_line="*delete*") OR
  command_line="*Remove-SmbShare*" OR
  comman_line="*Remove-FileShare*" )
output target_processes
```


#### Splunk Search - delete network shares (Splunk, Sysmon native)


looks network shares being deleted from the command line


```
(index=__your_sysmon_index__ EventCode=1) ((Image="C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe" AND CommandLine="*delete*") OR CommandLine="*Remove-SmbShare*" OR CommandLine="*Remove-FileShare*")
```


#### LogPoint Search - delete network shares (Logpoint, LogPoint native)


looks network shares being deleted from the command line


```
norm_id=WindowsSysmon event_id=1 ((image="C:\Windows\System32\net.exe" command="*delete*") OR command="*Remove-SmbShare*" OR command="*Remove-FileShare*")
```
