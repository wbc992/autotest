Services, or a service application, can be started automatically at system boot, by a user through the services control panel applet, or by an application that uses service functions. Services can execute even when no user is logged into the system.

## Actions

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|create|The event corresponding to the act of creating a new service.
|delete|The event corresponding to the act of deleting a service.
|pause|The event corresponding to the act of pausing a currently running service.
|start|The event corresponding to the act of starting a new service.
|stop|The event corresponding to the act of stopping a service that is currently running.

## Fields

|Field|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|command_line|The command line that service is started with.|`C:\windows\system32\svchost.exe -k rpcss`
|exe|The executable for the service.|`svchost.exe`
|fqdn|The fully qualified domain name of the host. Contains the hostname appended with the domain.|`Example: HOST1.EXAMPLE_DOMAIN.COM`
|hostname|The hostname of the host, without the domain.|`HOST1`
|image_path|Where in the file system the executable is located.|`C:\path\to\example.exe`
|name|The name of the service.|`RpcSs`
|ppid|The process ID of the process's parent, represented in decimal notation. In the parent process, this will be the pid field.|`1860`
|pid|The process ID for the process, represented in decimal notation.|`738`
|uid|The ID or SID of the user who acted on the service.|`S-1-5-18`
|user|The user context in which the thread that caused this event was running. May be a local, domain or SYSTEM user. Formatted as "\<DOMAIN\>\\\<USER>". Because threads are allowed to impersonate users, this may be different than the user context of the process. For service events, the user is almost always NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.|`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`
